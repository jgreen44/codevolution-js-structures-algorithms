# Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript

>JavaScript is a versatile programming language that can be used to implement a wide variety of data structures and 
> algorithms. In this README, we will discuss some specific data structures and algorithms that are commonly used in 
> JavaScript.

## Algorithms

### Math Algorithms

-   Factorial (with and without recursion)
-   Fibonacci Sequence (with and without recursion)
-   Power of Two
-   Prime Number

### Miscellaneous

-   Cartesian Product
-   Climbing Staircase
-   Tower of Hanoi

### Search

-   Binary Search (with and without recursion)
-   Linear Search

### Sorting

-   Bubble Sort
-   Insertion Sort
-   Merge Sort
-   Quick Sort

## Data Structures

### Built-In

-   Maps
-   Sets

### Custom

-   Adjacency List Graph
-   Adjacency Matrix Graph
-   Binary Search Tree
-   Circular Queue
-   Doubly Linked List
-   Hash Table
-   Linked List
-   Linked List (Queue)
-   Linked List (Stack)
-   Linked List (with tail)
-   Queue
-   Stack

>It's important to notice that these are just a few examples, and there are many other data structures and algorithms 
>that can be used in JavaScript depending on the specific needs of your project. Each data structure and algorithm has 
> its own set of advantages and use cases, and it's important to choose the right one for the task at hand.
